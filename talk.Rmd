## What is Machine Learning

##
![](images/machine-learning-xkcd.png)

## Interpretability
- The degree to which an observer can understand the cause of a decision.
- Current state in machine learning: Minimize loss, get best prediction, ignore interpretation
- Current state in statistics: Fit model, interpret output, ignore predictive performance
- Ideal world: Get best predictive performance + interpretability

## When is it important


## Different entry points
- Understand data better
- Use only interpretable models (sparse linear models, short decision trees, rules, ...)
- **Apply model-agnostic methods to make black boxes interpretable**

## Model-agnostic methods
- Not bound to model
- Use always the same type of explanation
- ...
- Disadvantage: Can't take advantage of internal structures
